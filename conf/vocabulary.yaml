  vocabulary: "You can add the vocabulary classes (variables to be used in the prompt) as keys and its possible values in the form of a list"
  prompt_templates: "Each template (with variables as in vocabulary keys) should be an element in the list. The variables in the templates should start with 'opt_<vocabulary key>'. In case of colors it should be 'opt_color<number>', where number is the color number of that template (opt_color1, opt_color2,..) if you possibly want a different color for each color number. Make sure that the color numbers are in increasing numerical order."
